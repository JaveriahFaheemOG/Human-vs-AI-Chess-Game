# ♟️ Human vs AI Chess Game (Jupyter Notebook)

This project is a **Jupyter Notebook implementation** of a Human vs AI Chess Game.  
It supports **complete chess rules**, **special moves**, and a **computer-controlled AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning**.  
The game uses **Tkinter** for the GUI, allowing players to play interactively against the AI.
